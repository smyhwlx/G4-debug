/*! \page Examples_parallel Category "parallel"

This directory includes example applications to demonstrate the usage of
different techniques for achieving event parallelism with Geant4.

- \link Examples_MPI MPI \endlink is a native interface with MPI libraries. 
  The directory contains 
  a Geant4 UI library and a couple of parallelized examples.
  Using this interface, users applications can be parllelized with 
  different MPI compliant libraries, such as LAM/MPI, MPICH2, OpenMPI,
  and so on. 
  <br><br>

- \link Examples_tbb Examples TBB \endlink demonstrate how to
  interface a simple application with the Intel Threading Building Blocks
  library (TBB), and organise MT event-level parallelism as TBB tasks.
